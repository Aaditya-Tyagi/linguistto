Google translator, Bing translator, and our own tagalog to filipino sentence translation tool, which is free on our website, are some of the prominent translation tools. While a transliteration does not reveal the meaning of the words, it can help you pronounce them correctly. Transliteration changes the letters from one alphabet or language into the corresponding, similar-sounding characters of another alphabet. Therefore, we can say, transliteration changes the letters from one alphabet into the similar-sounding characters of another alphabet. This makes it the simplest and fastest method of typing in filipino without practicing any filipino keyboard. You can either use the Google input tool for FREE."

It is vitally necessary to have effective communication amongst people from different cultural backgrounds to be successful. The translation is something that has the potential to alter the course of history through the process of disseminating new information. It is the sole means by which certain people can become acquainted with a variety of works that will help them to broaden their understanding of the world."
