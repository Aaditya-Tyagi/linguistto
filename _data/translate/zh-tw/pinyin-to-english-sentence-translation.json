Google translator, Bing translator, and our own pinyin to english sentence translation tool, which is free on our website, are some of the prominent translation tools. While a transliteration does not reveal the meaning of the words, it can help you pronounce them correctly. Transliteration changes the letters from one alphabet or language into the corresponding, similar-sounding characters of another alphabet. Therefore, we can say, transliteration changes the letters from one alphabet into the similar-sounding characters of another alphabet. This makes it the simplest and fastest method of typing in english without practicing any english keyboard. You can either use the Google input tool for FREE."

It is the sole means by which certain people can become acquainted with a variety of works that will help them to broaden their understanding of the world."
