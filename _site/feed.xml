&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A transitional paragraph is a paragraph in an essay, speech, composition, or report that signals a shift from one section, idea, or approach to another. Usually, in a short sentence, a transitional paragraph is most commonly used to summarize the ideas of one part of a text in preparation for the beginning of another part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bridging Paragraphs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Many writing teachers use the analogy that transitional paragraphs are like bridges: the first section of the essay is one riverbank; the second section is the other riverbank; the transitional paragraph, like a bridge, links them.”(Randy Devillez, Writing: Step by Step, 10th ed. Kendall/Hunt, 2003)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functions of Transitional Paragraphs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transitional paragraphs come into use when we write long essays. Such a paragraph can summarize what has been written. It may hint at what is to be expected by our inquisitive readers who read further on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powerful section changes sign to perusers how two successive passages identify with one another. The transition flags the connection between the “new data” and the “old data.” For instance, the new passage may&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;expound on the thought introduced in the former passage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;present a connected thought&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;proceed with a sequential story&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;depict an issue with the thought introduced in the first passage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;depict an exemption for the thought introduced in the former section&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;depict a result or ramifications of the thought introduced in the first passage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;depict a result or ramifications of the thought introduced in the first passage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should think about a couple of models (drawn from distributed books and articles of passage advances that work. The models beneath replicate section endings and openings. Focus on how each passage opening signs to readers how the section identifies with the one they have quite recently completed the process of perusing. Observe the loss in clarity when transitional signals are removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples of Transitional Paragraphs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paragraph ending -Once his system was applied to all acts of manual labor, Taylor assured his followers, it would bring about a restructuring not only of industry but of society, creating a utopia of perfect efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paragraph Opening with transitional cues - Taylor’s system is still very much with us; it remains the ethic of industrial manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paragraph opening without transitional cues - Taylor’s system is the ethic of present-day industrial manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transitional sentence signals that the new paragraph will seek to demonstrate that the phenomenon described in the preceding paragraph (Taylorism) is ongoing: it is “still” with us and “remains” the dominant workplace ethic. Compare this sentence with the one directly beneath it (“paragraph opening without transitional cues”). With this version, readers are left on their own to figure out the connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example 2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paragraph Ending- If the story concerns social crisis or disorder, more frequently than not this response will come from sources of official authority: the police quell the rioting, labor, and management leaders reach an agreement, the State Department approves or condemns the latest coup d’état in South America. The press in this way establishes a subtle relation between narrative order and the perception or representation of political order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paragraph opening with transitional cues - Todd Gitlin makes a similar point in commenting on the “orderliness” of television news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paragraph opening without transitional cues - Todd Gitlin comments on the “orderliness” of television news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transitional sentence signals that the new paragraph will further explore the idea expressed in the earlier paragraph. The phrase “makes a similar point” signals towards this relationship. Without this transitional phrase, the connection between the two paragraphs can still be understood but it is not quite clear. The above examples illustrate, effective paragraph transitions signal relationships between paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us look at some terms that are often helpful for signaling relationships among ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronology before, next, earlier, later, during, after&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a Transition word?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In straightforward terms, a progress word shows the connection between two segments of the content or communicate in language. By utilizing the symbolism of an extension, we can perceive how these words take us starting with one explanation then onto the next. By utilizing these words we can all the more likely form a sentence and pass on the thing we are attempting to say in a more brief manner. There is more than one kind of change word. This segment will present the most regularly utilized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinating transitions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elements in a coordinate relationship are equal in rank, quality, or significance. To show a connection between equivalent components, utilize an organizing change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show similarity or reinforce: and, also, too, similarly, equally, identically, equally important, together with, not only,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but also, coupled with, in the light of, not to mention, as well as, furthermore, moreover, in the same fashion/ way, likewise, comparatively, correspondingly, by the same token, uniquely, to say nothing of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To present a contradicting point: be that as it may, in any case, yet, in actuality, then again, conversely, still, not one or the other, nor, all things considered, other than.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To flag a restatement: that is, all in all, in less difficult terms, to put it in an unexpected way, in reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subordinating Transition words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing frequency: frequently, hourly, occasionally, every now and then, again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing tenure: briefly, for a long time, minute by minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing particular time: at that time, in those days, last Sunday, in 1947, next Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing beginning: in the meantime, meanwhile, at that moment, simultaneously&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing the end: in the end, at last, eventually&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spatial transition example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing closeness: next to, near, alongside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing distance: in the distant, far, away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing direction, up/ down, sideways, along, across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agreement transition words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first place, not only but also, as a matter of fact, like, as, again, in addition, in the same manner, equally, identically, first second and third, additionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compare and Contrast Transition Words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are some of the words that we can use to explain when comparing and contrasting two things? Let us look at some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the same way&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In like manner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Likewise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Similarly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By the same token&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, for instance, in the event that you were portraying the similarity between the paces of two distinct subspecies of lions, you could word it like so: ‘subspecies A can arrive at speeds up to 40 mph. Additionally, subspecies B can accomplish a limit of 35 mph. Could ‘furthermore’ advances fit into the area of relative expressions too? The appropriate response is ‘yes’. These can frequently be utilized to interface different attributes or highlights to one substance. For example, in the event that you need to examine the numerous advantages of activity yet don’t need your sentences to be excessively protracted. You could utilize change words like ‘also’ and ‘besides’, to list more advantages in another sentence. Here are a couple of instances of these correlation terms being used:‘Keeping your tires properly inflated can help prevent random blowouts on the road. In addition, it will also mean that you don’t have to spend money as often to replace them. ‘&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1.‘Having a morning cup of coffee will give you the energy you need to start off the day. 2.Furthermore, it will make sure that you don’t get grumpy as the day progresses.’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3.‘Learning to play instruments as a family will help you become much closer with each other. On top of that, you’ll have a really great time.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contrast Words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever would we manage without changes connoting contrast? There would be no chance to get for us to express our polar, extraordinary, and clashing thoughts, and subsequently discussions couldn’t exist. Thus, contrast words are vital to any paper. How about we investigate some extraordinary ‘classifications’ of these contrast words&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some ‘opposite transition words’: in contrast, conversely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some ‘ difference transition words’. Dissimilarly, a clear difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some ‘ conflict resolution transition words’: however, nevertheless, on the other hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison of Compare and Contrast transition words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everything is black and white in terms of which words fit into which category of transition words. There are, in fact, several situations where compare and contrast words can be utilized relying upon the unique circumstance. Let us investigate these ill-defined situations. Signal words what are they? These are general words that fall under both compare and contrast expressions. For instance: At the same time, On the other hand, While.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are summary transition words and phrases?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These compare and contrast transition words that are mostly used to wrap up sentences. These words include all things considered, to summarize, to sum up, all in all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples using compare and contrast sentences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using transition words can make your writing stand out and look more professional as they strengthen the connections between the ideas and the concepts that you are describing. Using these transition words is the key to sieve out a competent writer from a mediocre one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the paragraph above that the compare and contrast transition words are used for indication of similarity or differences of the ideas you want to describe. However budding writers must also remember that using compare and contrast or any other transition words requires great finesse and using them wisely makes your writing stand out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="general" /><summary type="html">Using transition words: Compare and Contrast</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/uploads/l-1.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/uploads/l-1.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Using appropriate transition words in sentences</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/general/using-appropriate-transition-words-in-sentences" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Using appropriate transition words in sentences" /><published>2021-02-18T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-02-18T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/general/using-appropriate-transition-words-in-sentences</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/general/using-appropriate-transition-words-in-sentences">&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-appropriate-transition-words-in-sentences&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using appropriate transition words in sentences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transitional words and phrases help make a piece of writing flow better and connect one idea to the next. Because there’s more than one way to connect ideas, there are many types of transitional phrases to show a variety of relationships. Using transition words in your writing can help you enhance the readability of your content. These words help your text flow and show readers the relationship between phrases and paragraphs. But what are they exactly? Why are they so important? And how should you use them? View several examples of transitional words and phrases used in sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are transitional words and phrases?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most basic used transitional words or conjunctions that we often use are, “and,” “but” and “or” to connect two sentences together. Let us see some familiar examples to understand how these words are used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.I ran to the park, and I just got there on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.I ran to the park but was still late. As you can see in the examples above, even simple conjunctions serve different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first sentence uses “and” as a transition word that connects the two occurrences equally.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second sentence uses “but,” which introduces a contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Knowing what kind of transition words to use comes in handy and helps you to get your point across. These words show the relationship between the phrases, paragraphs and sentences that we write. Using this kind of words makes it easier to read our texts and understand them in a better manner. Let us see some examples to understand this better:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I pushed the domino. As a result, it fell over.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When you start a sentence with ‘as a result’, your reader will immediately know two things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What happened in the first sentence caused something;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The second sentence is going to describe the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;By using the phrase ‘as a result’ here, you show that the two separate sentences are part of one process. Without reading the whole sentences, your potential reader can well in advance guess what is likely to come next. We can also say that these transition words are like a glue that holds our sentences together. With them, the individual parts come together to form one whole. Transition words don’t always have to be placed at the beginning of a sentence. Consider the following example.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Harsil is a very nice guy. He took us out to dinner yesterday, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In this example, ‘for instance’ is placed at the end of the sentence. Nonetheless, it still provides the reader with information as to how the two sentences are related.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I enjoy his company because he always tells interesting stories.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In this example, ‘because’ doesn’t connect two sentences, but two clauses. Transition words can connect anything from short phrases to entire paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Adverb transition words - Other transition words are adverbs that describe the way an action is performed or how it relates to another idea. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;I went to the waterpark &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; he gave me my paycheck.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bowling is a sport in which the player with the highest score wins. &lt;strong&gt;Conversely&lt;/strong&gt;, the goal in golf is to get the lowest score.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;to get the lowest score.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of Transition words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/1.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/3.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/4.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/5.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding transition words using everyday examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I’m going to discuss a few reasons why practice is important to learning skills. The only way to truly master a skill is by actually doing what you’ll have to do in the real world. I think practice can be a fun way of putting in the necessary hours. There are some people who will disagree. It is said that people tend to remember only 10-20% of what they’ve heard or read. That number rises to as much as 90% when you put theory to practice. Following up an explanation with practice is key to mastering a skill.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this paragraph&lt;/strong&gt;, I’m going to discuss a few reasons why practice is important to mastering skills. &lt;strong&gt;Firstly&lt;/strong&gt;, the only way to truly learn a skill is by actually doing what you’ll have to do in the real world. &lt;strong&gt;Secondly&lt;/strong&gt;, I think practice can be a fun way of putting in the necessary hours. There are, &lt;strong&gt;however&lt;/strong&gt;, some people who will disagree. &lt;strong&gt;Thirdly&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;most importantly&lt;/strong&gt;, it is said that people tend to remember only 10-20% of what they read or hear. &lt;strong&gt;Moreover&lt;/strong&gt;, that number rises to as much as 90% when you put theory to practice. &lt;strong&gt;In conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;, following up explanation with practice is key to mastering a skill.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Text A though not a bad paragraph lacks the finesse of Text B. ext B does a better job of showing there are three separate arguments to support the statement with a definite conclusion. Readers are going to be more intrigued while reading Text B as compared to the contents in Text A as the latter explains in a better manner.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tricks to improve: smooth experience in transition writing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Creating a smooth writing experience is like maintaining a bicycle chain. When your chain gets muddy, it starts to squeak and rattle. Pedaling becomes harder. And perhaps the chain might even drop off. In order to have a smooth riding experience, you first remove the dirt from your chain, and then you apply lubricant to reduce friction and prevent rust. When editing your content, you do exactly the same. First, you remove the dirt from your content—you eliminate unwanted words and replace weak words. And then you apply writer’s lube—which is the transitional tricks for a smooth reading experience.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transition trick #1:&lt;/strong&gt; Drops of light oil&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Much the same as drops of oil make your bike chain move without friction, transitional words make readers glide through your content.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Transitional words make the reading experience smoother since they clarify the connection between two sentences. Instances of temporary words are:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;And&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;But&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Or&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;However&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;In contrast&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Because&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;For instance&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;So&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You can either use transitional words at the beginning of a sentence to explain the relation with a previous sentence or to connect two parts of one sentence. Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;She has ideas to share, but nobody listens&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you want to shout, Hey you listen!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Now read these sentences aloud and you will notice how abrupt these phrases are. Your writing requires little variation in order to sound interesting. Now let us remove the transitional words and read again.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;She has ideas to share. nobody listens&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You want to shout, Hey you listen!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transition trick #2:&lt;/strong&gt; Like changing gears. Yes, just like in cycling, in writing you often move up or down a gear. For instance, in your introductory paragraph, you’ve explained to your reader that you have understood the problem and will aim to solve it. To indicate the start of the section with tips, use a short and engaging question:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Are you ready to get started?&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Does this sound good?&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Shall we begin?&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Therefore, addressing your readers with short questions makes your content conversational and engaging, and it encourages your readers to read on.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transition trick #3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I bought a new bicycle. But each time I cycled uphill and changed gears, the chain fell off. To sort out this chain frustration, I now have a rubber dog fang. The dog fang prevents the chain from falling off. Similarly, we need such dog fangs in our writing too.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Keep your reader intrigued with short phrases like:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Let me explain why&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;And now comes the best part&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Not only that&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;What’s more&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Even more importantly&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transition trick #4:&lt;/strong&gt; The Connectors&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The secret involved in successfully moving from topic to topic without losing your readers or listeners is word connectors. Word connectors are words that are repeated subsequently in many sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A coke quenches your thirst and appears to give energy, but its nutritional value is low. A fruit smoothie sounds healthy but may have a ton of added sweeteners.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Similarly, words with low nutritional value will seem to have a meaning, but their meaning is not quite strong.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Therefore, repeating a variation of the phrase “low nutritional value” helps readers move to the next topic.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transition trick #5:&lt;/strong&gt; Using Pronouns&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Pronouns (words like they, it, he, her) play a similar role as word connectors, but you have to be careful what or whom the pronoun refers to.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;For example, The kid was angry with her mother because of her ice cream. Instead, let us try to write, The kid was angry because she had only one scoop of ice cream, and her mother took three scoops. Ambiguity confuses readers and makes them stop to consider your message. Hence we should be clear so that our readers glide through the text effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transition trick #6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Bicyclists can argue for hours about the best way to keep your bike chain free from rust. Use Tri-flow. Use light oil. Re-lube more often. Hence, your content also needs a mix of tricks for the smoothest reading experience.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Make sure your subheading arouse curiosity or promise a benefit for the readers. When your reader’s mind starts to wander off, a startling subhead intrigues him back. It encourages people to keep reading and move on to the next topic with great agility.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Transition words are therefore very important for the readability of your text. However, most people struggle in successfully implementing them. If you do practice them, you will be effortlessly able to use them in your phrases.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expressed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a conclusion paragraph, you sum up what you’ve expounded on in your paper. At the point when you’re composing a decent end section, you need to consider the central matter that you need to get across and be certain it’s incorporated. In the event that you’ve just composed a marvelous basic section, you can compose something comparative with various phrasing. Here are a few focuses to recall:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utilize your introductory paragraph as a guide. You may have begun by saying, “There are three classes at school that I totally can hardly wait to go to consistently.” You can begin your decision by saying, “Exercise center, Math, and Art are the three classes I attempt to never miss.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your theme for each body section ought to be summed up in the end&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrap up the primary concerns&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your end sentence should help the readers feel a feeling of conclusion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your end sentence is your final word regarding the matter; it is your “cherry on top”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show the significance of your thoughts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings the reader round trip&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allude to the basic section by utilizing watchwords, or equal ideas and pictures that you likewise utilized in the presentation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sum up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essay conclusion— Should music with curse words be allowed at school dances?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language can be powerful and sometimes even harmful, but censorship of language is one of the worst things we can do as a society. I believe that the content of the song is more important than a few curse words. If a song’s content is designed to provoke, intimidate, or make someone feel inferior, then I believe that is more harmful than a few impolite words in a chorus.&lt;/p&gt;

The proficiency and command over the language include the ability to produce complex sentences utilizing the key vocabulary of the subject area as well as functional words and phrases that show comparison, sequencing, description, cause, and effect, and more. Therefore in many schools and colleges, the teachers try to teach the students the art of sentence starters in order to help them attain language proficiency. As the name implies, therefore sentence starters provide a frame to the students Signal words are those words and phrases that clue in the reader or listener to the purpose of the message.

&lt;p&gt;To start the conversation on sentence casings, starters, and sign words, it is useful to investigate the thought of language capacities and their connected structures.

For example, if students are to compare two ocean creatures, they might say something like “Whales have lungs, but fish have gills.” In the preceding sentence, the simple frame is “&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt; have &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, but __&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_ have __&lt;/strong&gt;___. Note the sentence can be filled in with any content; this differs from closed sentences that often have only a few possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase the complexity of the sentence, we can change the frame to incorporate a different structure and higher-level academic terms. Note how the following examples increase the level of language used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;___ have __&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, however &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;___ have __&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;_____.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whereas &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__have __&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;have __&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;__&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Despite the fact that &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;_ have &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;__ have &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create sentence outlines, thoroughly consider the assortment of ways you could react to a brief, clarify an idea, and so forth Writings can give you thoughts of perplexing or compound sentences too; eliminate the key jargon and search for the design of the sentences. These can be dismembered and imparted to students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples (Sentence Starters)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like the sentence frames, sentence starters also provide a fair idea to the students regarding how to begin their sentences. For example, students sequencing a series of events might use the following sentence starters in their oral or written summaries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that happened was&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following important event was&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the story&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usage of signal words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signal words are terms that signal to the reader what the purpose of the text is. Signal words also consist of transition words like despite, however, and therefore. It also contains words and phrases that are specific to particular language functions. Sample signal words and phrases are :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cause and effect:&lt;/strong&gt; If … then, for this reason, so, because, one reason for, thus, consequently, accordingly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description and elaboration:&lt;/strong&gt; Includes, belongs, is called, explain, for example, in other words, described, such as&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story starters are probably the most difficult for those involved in creative content writing. It is not very easy to come up with exceptional ideas and sometimes can involve 30 minutes of useless brainstorming. Sometimes even if you have a great idea, getting that exceptionally good opening sentence is a task. However, once you have found your opening sentence, the rest becomes an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve made it easy for you by putting together a long list of story starter sentences to give you the inspiration you need to start on your next creative writing project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write your own story: tips and tricks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tip #1 – Take Action!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous accounts get going with “There used to be… “ or “Sometime in the distant past.” Instead, scholars should be urged to make a move quickly in their stories. Make a plunge directly in the center of some activity. It’s a great method to make perusers immediately inquisitive about what’s going on. Maybe the story starts during a discussion or quickly flaunts a vital part of the primary character. Not exclusively does beginning with activity attract readers, however, children may likewise think that it’s simpler to continue to compose a story once an occasion is as of now occurring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tip #2 – Develop Personalities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters in the accounts should have some character characteristics that make them stick out, and afterward, kids expound on practices that mirror the personality of each character. For instance, a laidback character may cherish keeping awake until late and snoozing, while a dependable character may hit the sack before and get up at daybreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tip #3 – Add Adjectives&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As students begin composing their own accounts, urge them to broadly expound with heaps of modifiers. In some cases children may think that it’s extreme to give word pictures of settings or characters, utilizing unclear language all things considered. They can begin by generously adding in whatever number modifiers as could be allowed to depict their characters and settings, and later any unessential subtleties can generally be taken out. It’s hard to have a dazzling story if there aren’t fascinating depictions and subtleties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tip #4 – Move the Story Toward a Climax&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories need to move towards a peak or occasion. There’s generally an issue or emergency that should be settled before the story closes. Assist kids with figuring out which subtleties in their accounts help push the plot ahead, and which components of their story do not have a reason in moving the story along. Illustrating a rundown of the story’s headliners that pave the way to the activity can make it simpler for youngsters to figure out which plot focuses they should hit to get to the peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tip #5 – To end the study, students need to bring the story full circle. They can clarify how the issue was settled or talk about what occurred after the peak. An extraordinary method to end a story is to bring it round trip from the earliest starting point. Have children think back to the start of their accounts and make note of the settings and key subtleties. They can be brought back again in another manner to help finish up the story so readers finally accept reality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="general" /><summary type="html">How to write creative stories - some sentence starters</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/uploads/9.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/uploads/9.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Language and its importance</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/language-and-its-importance" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Language and its importance" /><published>2021-02-08T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-02-08T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/language-and-its-importance</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/language-and-its-importance">&lt;h3 id=&quot;language-and-its-importance&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language and its importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language is regularly what characterizes societies and nations the most. Regardless of whether you are talking one of the universes greatest dialects, similar to Spanish, English, or Mandarin, or a more modest, more detached language like Basque, Chinook, or Romani, this type of openness is of the utmost importance for practically every part of our lives. In this article, we will investigate those with the longest and most assorted letter sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ranking languages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per Ethnologue.com, there are 7117 communicated in dialects around the globe, and the work of estimating a dialects letter set is entirely minimal more confounded than it may appear. The principal issue is the manner by which to tally a letters in order. Take spanish for instance; the vowels ‘A, E, I, O, U’ all exist in its letters in order, however they additionally all have emphasized structures. Do these consider extra characters inside a letters in order, or would they say they are basically minor departure from existing letters? With the end goal of this article, we will say simply that. In the event that a language remembers a set rundown of letters for its letters in order, and doesn’t tally complemented characters or joined varieties, we will tally it without them. We additionally will exclude dialects, for example, Mandarin or Cantonese, where the term letters in order doesn’t straightforwardly apply. These dialects have ideographic composing frameworks, otherwise called pictographs, and don’t fall precisely into the letter set framework for which we will check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rank 1: Smaller Alphabets (21 - 26 Letters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of you perusing this will be acquainted with a portion of the dialects in this positioning. We are including these to offer setting to the size of dialects later on positions. How about we start for certain mainstream European dialects. English, has 26 letters dependent on Latin Script, as is German and French with 26 also, and Spanish with 27. Italian has an astounding 21 letters in its letter set, giving it the least in our first position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rank 2: Larger Alphabets (28 - 46 Letters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as we move past a portion of the dialects we’re utilized to, we begin to discover bigger and more unpredictable composing frameworks. Arabic for instance, has 28 letters in its language, which are all viewed as consonants, Arabic does obviously have vowels, yet they are rather appeared by a ‘diacritical imprint’ or glyph that is added to the current letters. At that point there is the Russian letter set comprising of 33 letters. 10 of these are vowels, 21 are consonants and an extra two ‘signs’ or ‘modifiers’ additionally used to make words. At last, in our subsequent position, we have Japanese. Presently, the facts demonstrate that Japanese is an ideographic language, with Kanji being the most well known of it’s three composing frameworks, yet not at all like Chinese, Japanese has two phonetic letters in order, hiragana and katakana, which can both be included in our rankings. The two dialects have an aggregate of 46 letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rank 3: The Biggest Alphabets (50 - 75 Letters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presently we are in the higher class of letter set lengths, and we begin to break the 50 letters mark. Hindi, the most communicated in language in the entirety of India, has a letters in order comprising of 12 vowels, 33 consonants, and somewhere in the range of 5 and 7 compound characters, giving it an aggregate of somewhere in the range of 50 and 52 letters (This number changes among various areas of India). Next up we have Nepali, a language that verifiably has outgrown an area with long and complex composing frameworks. Nepali has 64 letters in its letter set, the biggest we have discussed up until this point, yet lamentably, it doesn’t take the best position. That delight tumbles to Khmer. As per the Guinness Book Of World Records, the Khmer Language has the biggest letters in order on the planet, with a sum of 74 letters, comprising of 33 consonants, 23 vowels and 12 free vowels. Regularly alluded to as Cambodian, Khmer is really spoken in numerous nations in Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Vietnam, and a few pieces of Laos. The language has an aggregate of 16 million local speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mongolian has one of the longest word lengths, by letter, on the planet, with a normal of 13 letters for every word!&lt;/p&gt;

Many dread learning Mandarin because of its 50,000 distinct characters – which, in contrast with the 26-letter letters in order, are very scary – yet 2,500 characters would be sufficient for ordinary Mandarin to be perceived. We believe it merits the devotion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Hindi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What number of individuals communicate in Hindi? 615 million speakers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know? The Hindi language doesn’t utilize “the”, or what we call an unequivocal article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many may connect the Hindi language with beautiful Bollywood motion pictures or the disordered traffic in Delhi. Be that as it may, Hindi has quite a lot more to give, for example, 615 million possible companions and admittance to an amazing assortment of societies! Giving this Indo-Aryan language a possibility will permit you to find not just unimaginable music, engaging movies, and endearing individuals, it will likewise permit you to see exactly how intently it actually works with English.

&lt;p&gt;Did you know? Spanish is likewise the authority language of a nation in Central Africa, Equatorial Guinea.&lt;/p&gt;

It has likewise seen an unimaginable improvement in its number of speakers because of its developing social impact.

The Francophone populace is additionally expected to arrive at 572 million speakers continuously 2030 because of the developing populace in the African landmass. Having said that, France keeps on being a colossal fascination and a vital nation for world governmental issues. The social assortment and rich history it gives us admittance to is a great motivation to begin learning this Romance language today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely endangered - children no longer learn the language as a ‘mother tongue’ in the home&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Severely endangered - language is spoken by grandparents and older generations; while the parent generation may understand it, they do not speak it to children or among themselves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language ranking difficulty for English Speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/language-difficulty_5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning another dialect as a grown-up is huge endeavor – so on the off chance that you need the best an incentive for your time, pick carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classification I: The Quick Ones&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classification I dialects are the least demanding for English speakers, who can arrive at perusing and talking capability inside about a large portion of a time of extreme investigation. There is a blend of Romance and Germanic dialects in this arrangement, including Dutch, Swedish, French, Spanish, and Italian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It very well may be astounding likewise to discover that Afrikaans is in this “most straightforward” classification also. It utilizes 26 letters in its letters in order like English (despite the fact that it likewise contains extra phonetic sounds), and shares a ton practically speaking with current Dutch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classification II: Es ist schwer zu sagen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that German is firmly identified with English, there are sentence structure idiosyncrasies that knock it up in trouble. FSI gauges it would require 30 weeks of exceptional investigation to get capable in German.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classification III: Intermediate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classification III dialects are predominantly spoken in Southeast Asia, and they incorporate Indonesian and Malay. Swahili likewise considers a Category III language. (Note: there are no Category III dialects spoken in Europe.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Class IV: For individuals who like a test&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classification IV incorporates the most testing European dialects for English speakers to get. Here you’ll discover Slavic and Baltic dialects, for example, Polish, Croatian, and Latvian, just as Greek, Turkish, and Icelandic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This classification additionally incorporates Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian. These Uralic dialects have the differentiation of being especially trying for English speakers to dominate as they share little for all intents and purpose with some other European dialects. FSI gauges it would require a time of serious examination to get capable in these dialects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classification V: For individuals who truly like a test&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dialects in classification V are the most trying for English speakers since they by and large have totally new contents and social presumptions. These dialects are generally normal in Asia and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Mandarin, Arabic, and Korean are adequately hard to appreciate, Japanese has gained notoriety for being the hardest in this gathering much obliged, to some extent, to numerous composing styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dominating Japanese could require years, yet FSI gauges that it’ll be in any event 88 weeks before you’re visiting your way through Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons for learning any foreign language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the point when most of individuals state “I will get familiar with another dialect this year” they never truly think about the significance of learning an unknown dialect and how it can help them for quite a long time to come.
